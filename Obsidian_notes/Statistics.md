## Maximum likelihood estimation

It is a method for estimating the parameters of an assumed probability distribution, given some observed data. This is achieved by maximizing a likelihood function (it is the joint probability of observed data viewed as a function of the parameters of a statistical model) so that, under the assumed statistical model, the observed data is most probable. 

It comes handy when a linear relationship is not appropriate for describing our data.
