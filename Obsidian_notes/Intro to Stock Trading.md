**Definition: Shares:** The capital of a company is divided into shares. Each share forms a unit of ownership of a company and it is offered for sale so as to raise capital for the company. It is an indivisible unit of capital, expressing the ownership relationship between the company and the shareholder

**Difference between Stocks and Shares:** In general they are used interchangeably. Nevertheless, there is a subtle difference, ***shares*** makes reference to the owner ship of a specific company, while ***stocks*** to the ownership of different companies. 

## Trading accounts
There are 3 different categories where you can invert. Starting from the lowest to the highest money wise

* **Standard accounts:** Open an account with *Robinhood* or *Webull*. Not buying power (1x)
* **proprietary trading account:** **Active day trader** you are going to need *proprietary trading account*, the minimum is ***$5000*** and you need to take two exams in order to get registered as a prop trader. Once you get this, you will obtain what is called ==buying power==  (20x)
* **Retail account:** Minimum account balance required ***$25000*** and you will have a buying power of 4x. For example TD Ameritrade, Charles Shwab, Interactive Brokers. The minimum balance has to be maintained

*What does buying power means?* Let's say I want to invert $1000, with x times buying power it means that I will have x times my initial money to buy stocks. For example if I have a prop account my $1000 will be $20000 to invert. ***Definition:*** The amount of money you have available in your trading account and the amount of money a firm will afford you to trade with.

## Market Terms

Different vehicles to trade.

* **Standard and Poor's 500**: (SPY) it ranks different stocks in the market. It is an index used to check how well a company is doing. It is frequently checked before making a trade
* **Market Marker**: It is a tool used to evaluate stock prices and create purchase/sell orders
* **Bid**: It represents the highest current price someone is willing to pay for the particular stock
* **The Ask**: it represents the lowest current price someone is willing to sell their stock for
* **Size**: It is the amount of shares of the particular stock available to buy in hundred (add to zeros to the number appears there)
***There are to buy for buying shares of a particular stock***
1. *Limit Order:* It is a "take-profit" order placed to buy or sell a set amount of stock at a specific price or better.
It means that in a Limit order I define how many shares I want to buy and which price I am willing to pay
2. *Market Order:* It is a simple order placed to buy or sell the current market price of the stock 

**Definition: P/E'S:** It stands for **"Price to earning ratio"**. It is an indicator of how good a company is doing and it helps to select good companies to invest. Companies in *troubles* has a P/E lower than 10, companies that are *growing* and *doing good* have P/E of 25 or higher.
***How to compute it?*** Let's say that a company has ***E***arnings ***P***er ***S***hare (***EPS***) of $6.50 over the last 12 months and the stock trades for $100. 
$$
P/E = \frac{Stock \;Price}{Earnings \;Per \; Share} = \frac{P}{EPS}
$$
so for this case it will be 100/6.5=15, which is a good value for a company.
*According to the previous equation* for a company to have a good P/E it should have a good stock price and a lower earning per share.

* By using this metric an investor can see the value of a stock in terms of how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar or earning 
* ***Why is this important*** 
Let's consider the cases in which P/E can be high:
1. That EPS is low and P is high. In this case a company doesn't have high earnings per share but people will pay a lot for shares. This doesn't happen in real life.
2. In fact, a good company is expected to have a high EPS, so in order to have a high P/E it means that the stock price has to be higher than the EPS.  

**Definition: Earnings Per Share (EPS):** It is calculated a company's profit divided by the outstanding shares of its common stock. ***The higher a company's EPS, the more profitable it is considered to be***. It indicates how much money a company makes for each of its stock and is a widely used metric for estimating corporate value.
* A higher EPS indicates that investors will pay more for a company's shares if they think the company has higher profits relatives to its share price
* The way to calculate it is dividing the net income (profits or earnings) by the amount of available shares

==**TAKE AWAY** It is safe and a really good option to buy stocks from companies with a high P/E==

==*you must "skate" where the earnings are going to be, not to where they have been*==

**Earnings that are about to collapse**:
In an example, a P/E of 8 might turn to be a P/E of 100. Pay a cheap price for a stock that is going to zero is never a good deal. This situations are called ***value traps***

#### Make Money with Growing Stocks

1. First rule: ***Ignore the high P/E***. They might not even have any earnings. By doing this you will be in a safe space. In the range of high P/E you can find companies that are not making any earning or companies that are growing and then they will explode. In this range you can find companies as Microsoft, Starbucks, Home Depot.
So focus your attention on companies that are hitting new 52-week highs, or even all-time new highs. It is risky, but a lot of good companies have this common feature. A good time with this kind of companies is that ***everyone who owns the stock has a profit*** 

**You can find them** by constantly scouring the list of stocks at 52-weeks highs or new all-time highs, which you can find here http://www.barchart.com/stocks/highs-lows/highs?timeFrame=1y
Then look into the a daily chart of each stock. I want to make sure that the stock is trading above its 50-day moving average, and that the 50 day moving average is above the 200 day moving average

### Long and short

Normally when you buy stocks you want the price go up from the price you bought. But when you **short a stock** we need it to *go down from the price* that we sold it. 
**How does short work?** you sell stocks that are not yours but you borrow them from a firm with an agreement to pay for them at market price at a later date with the hope that the price of the stock will go down at a later time.
==in my own words== Let's say I borrow stocks on Monday from a certain firm and I agree with them to pay for those stocks at market price on Friday. So I check during the week and I decide to sell those stock on Thursday for $100, then when Friday comes the market price for those stocks was $90, which gave me $10 profit.

**Longing stocks** The act of buying shares of a stock with the hopes that the price will increase and you will be able to eventually sell them for more than you paid for them.

#### What are bulls and bears in the stock market?

A bull is someone in favor and believer of a stock or the stock market going up. A bear is someone in favor and believer of a stock or the stock market going down. When the market is looking bullish, it means the stock market is going up. When the market is looking bearish, it means the stock market is going down.

#### What is a point?

One point is equal to one dollar.

#### Technical Analysis and Fundamental Analysis

*Fundamental analysis* is when you analyze a stock based on the businesses earnings, the value of the business the overall state of the business, the overall state of the stock market and many other basic factors. $\rightarrow$ ***long term investments***
*Technical analysis* what we use as ==day traders== since we are only looking to get involved in stocks for only a few hours at a time. Technical analysis **is the study of stock charts, and tools we use to help our trading decisions.**

Fundamental analysis $\rightarrow$ Long term investments
Technical analysis $\rightarrow$ Day traders

* Look for stocks that have a market cap of $ 5 billion or less. It takes a lot less money to push a $ 5 billion stock higher than it does a $500 billion market cap stock. Some mutual funds cannot look to markets with market cap lower than $5 billion.
* **Advice** To look for growth stocks where the *float* is less than 20% of the total number of shares outstanding 

**Definition** ***Float*** Number of shares of a stock that actually available for trading.

*Conclusion* Look for growth stocks in which there are not so many stocks for sale.

**Definition** ***Short interest*** It is the quantity of shares that have been sold short by those who believe that the stock will go down. ==Advice== stay away from stocks with *high short interest*. Hated stocks will have a short interest as a percentage of float that is anywhere from 10-50%
$\rightarrow$ Look for stocks with high short interest and that are reaching new highs. Explanation: Usually when this happens, short sellers (people that buy and sell stocks in a short term) will try to buy these stocks and the price will go even higher.

#### When to sell them?
Some advices given by the book are:
* Take profits if a stock moves up 100% in two weeks or less
* Take profits when you are up 300% from your entry price
* Take profits when the stock becomes crowded and hence dangerous (more people speaks about that stocks and advertise to buy it). ***Question*** But following this last recommendation could be dangerous because, for example, S&P or twitter or Google are companies that everyone talks about buying stocks from them.
#### When to leave (exit)

* Exit (with profit or loss) when the stock closes below its 50-day moving average. (for shorter moves)
* Exit when it closes below its 200-day moving average  (for longer moves)
* Exit when the 50-day moving average closes below the 200-day moving average (longer moves)
* Use a 10-day or 20-day ***E***xponential ***M***oving ***A***verage (***EMA***) as a trailing stop. Exits your position if the stock has a daily close below this EMA

## Make Money With IPO'S

**Definition** ***IPO*** Initial Public Offering. It happens when a formerly private company decides to take on outside investors.
*To take into account* when buying IPO's there is the risk that people from inside the company are trying to cash out their money and maybe the company is not doing so great. So just consider how the company operates and get well informed about it.

#### Two ways to approach an IPO
1. *Long-term investor* Be careful, there are so many IPO's and many of them go bankrupt after only 5 years. You need to know about the industry, company, Fundamental analysis. It is better to buy an IPO in it early life, there will be more chances or high earning but also it is more risky. For example Amazon went public just 3 years after its creation but Uber 10 years. Despite Uber had a bigger market when wet public most of the earnings when to private investors by that time. But Amazon had increased its profits and value more than 2 thousand times.
2. *From a trader's perspective* An IPO with a small float has the potential to go up or down a lot, which makes it a great trading vehicle. Try to look for no hype companies and the ones no sot well known but with a good projection.

## How To Profit From A Stock That Is Going Nowhere


## A Day Trading Strategy That Actually Works

It is about any strategy that *involves buying and selling a stock on the same day*. A day trader will never hold a position overnight. 
This strategy takes advantage of a ***basic fact of market structure*** ==It takes time for big players to enter and exit their positions== When millions of shared from a stock are being hold it will take even week to leave them (exit its position) , depending on how liquid the stock is. The good news is that small traders can take advantage of this. Once we see their footprints in a stock's price behavior, we can step in front of them and quickly execute our small order. Our order won't pull the stock in any direction. 

By jumping in front of a large institutional player, we can come along for the ride as the mutual fund or hedge fund continues to push the stock up with its buying, or go down with its selling.
